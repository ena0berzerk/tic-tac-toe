# What we should compare?
- main array board & combinationWin arr?
OR
- main array board & elements in DOM
Need to compare 3 in a row certain marker (X or O)

datacellWin = [
[]
]

winCondition {
  [0, 1, 2]
}

if (boardArr.length.3.includes('X') && [0, 1, 2] === boardArr) {
    print WINS
}


boardArr return [0: 'X', 1: 'X', 2: 'X' ...]

Every per-game turn check for win or tie
if (boardArr === winCondition {
then WIN
}
